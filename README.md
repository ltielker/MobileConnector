# MobileConnector

The purpose of this project is a background process, living in the Systemtray on your pc which listens to an open
port for a fitting code to be transmitted to do one of the following actions:

- lock the workstation
- send the workstation to sleep
- shutdown the workstation

At the moment it is a work-in-progress-project wich I work on during my free time. At the moment the mechanisms to run
the described actions are working, the process functions outside my IDE, and it already lives inside the Systemtray,
but it is nowhere near the remote action stuff I envisioned for it. But if you are partitioned maybe someday the
project will be completed.

### Current Tasks I am working on
- Stopping the action in the 5-second timeframe through the press of the escape key
- Fixing the Systemtray icon
- Port listening
- Remote action
